 Web Application (Web App) is a software program that runs on a remote server and is accessed through a web browser over the internet. Unlike traditional apps that require installation on your device, web apps work directly from your browser whether it's Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.
Many people confuse web apps and websites since both are accessed through a web browser and need an internet connection. However, they serve different purposes.
